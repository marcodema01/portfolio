          Ex Machina is an interactive installation that immerses visitors in
          the heart of an artificially generated cult set between a past shaped
          by ancient rituals and a post-industrial future where artificial
          artifacts become icons of worship. Three objects act as a bridge
          between reality and the cult’s domain, their forms reverberating like
          a distorted echo within the archive’s images. By grasping and engaging
          with these objects, visitors navigate a photographic archive composed
          of fleeting, stolen glimpses into the cult’s existence, where gestures
          transform into rituals.

        <h1>The Idea</h1>
        <p class="prj-description-text">
          The idea initially arises from the intention of placing a medium at
          the center of the installation—an object capable of existing
          simultaneously both in the reality of the viewer and in the
          artificially generated reality of the images. Interaction with it
          creates a sense of misalignment with reality, catapulting the visitor
          into the reality of the archive. After generating various ideas around
          this theme, we decided to pursue the artificial creation of a
          religious cult. Religious artifacts, since the dawn of time, have
          carried with them a legacy of superstitions and beliefs—what would
          happen if an artifact truly had power?

        <p class="prj-description-text">
          We used Replicate to train an AI model and use it to generate the
          images. In the end, we developed three main tokens for the three
          objects, along with two additional ones for high-quality flash
          photography and close-up shots.

        <span class="subtitle">THE OBJECTS</span>
        <p class="prj-description-text">
          The process of designing the objects was preceded by a schematization
          of possible forms and their role within the navigation of the archive.
          From there, we chose three paths. The first object would be linked to
          the concept of aggregation, the second to contemplation, and the third
          to power—three themes closely tied to the notion of worship. <br />
          <br />
          We started prototyping the objects by experimenting with different
          finishing techniques for 3D printing, aiming to achieve the effect of
          an artifact that was not entirely perfect but showed signs of wear and
          use. To this end, we decided to hand-fill the 3D-printed object and
          then finish it with a metallic paint. The process was therefore
          conceptually the same as the design phase: a digital artifact that is
          subsequently worked on and refined by human hands.

          The main interactions are picking up the object and manipulating it.
          In order to recognize that interaction, each object contains an
          Arduino Nano ESP32, a small rechargeable battery and an accelerometer.
          The setup is designed to be as compact as possible to keep the objects
          relatively small and easy to handle.

          The exhibition features a projector that presents three different
          archives of images generated by artificial intelligence, each
          representing a distinct concept: aggregation, contemplation, and
          power—all revolving around the central theme of the cult. These three
          ideas are materialized through three different objects that visitors
          can pick up and move to interact with the image archives. When a
          visitor picks up an object, the corresponding archive becomes visible
          on the wall, accompanied by evocative sounds. Picking up a second or
          third object splits the screen, displaying multiple archives
          simultaneously. The images appear one after the other at a speed
          determined by the object’s inclination: the more horizontal it is, the
          faster the archive progresses, and the higher the volume of the
          accompanying sounds.
